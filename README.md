# Loan-calculator
A loan eligibility calculator aiming to reduce algorithmic biases. 
Made for Hack the Globe 2022 by Team 32.

This code acts as a framework which banks/lenders can use to build on and improve their own loan eligability algorith,
in order to reduce biases towards those of lower income (which often includes many marginalised groups) 
by determining their eligability for a loan without the use of a credit score, 
and also makes them less riskier to lend to by offering more affordable loan repayment plans.
